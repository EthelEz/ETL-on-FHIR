# Project description
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) revolutionizes data exchange in healthcare, enhancing interoperability across systems. One of the reasons for performing ETL by moving data from an FHIR API to a Postgres database is to enable better data management, analysis, and utilization, ultimately improving healthcare workflows and patient care.

# Getting started
To demonstrate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from an Azure FHIR API to a PostgresDB. It is advisable to understand why you want to perform the ETL. Secondly, it's good to have knowledge of the following:
1. FHIR Standards:
Familiarize yourself with the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard using the [FHIR Documentation](https://fhir-ru.github.io/documentation.html). However, a good knowledge of [FHIR resources RESTful APIs, searching and the principles](https://fhir-ru.github.io/search.html) of data exchange in healthcare is important.

2. Knowledge of Postgres Database and queries:
